<p>(See the github repo <a href="https://github.com/InductiveStep/Russia-Report">here</a>.)</p>
<p>The UK’s Intelligence and Security Committee’s report into Russian activity in the UK was finally on the 21 July 2020.</p>
<p>The heavily-redacted text is available on the <a href="http://isc.independent.gov.uk/news-archive/21july2020">ISC website</a> and <a href="20200721_HC632_CCS001_CCS1019402408-001_ISC_Russia_Report_Web_Accessible.pdf">in this github repository</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to have a look with the aid of some tidyverse widgets.</p>
<p>First, load packages and the text into R.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>devtools::install_github(&quot;inductivestep/handbag&quot;)
library(handbag)
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(pdftools)
library(stringr)
rr_text &lt;- pdf_text(&quot;20200721_HC632_CCS001_CCS1019402408-001_ISC_Russia_Report_Web_Accessible.pdf&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>pdf_text</code> command returns a character vector with one element per PDF page. The main report text is on pages 8-42.</p>
<div id="first-go" class="section level1">
<h1>First go</h1>
<div id="finding-the-juiciest-pages" class="section level2">
<h2>Finding the juiciest pages</h2>
<p>I’d like to know where the juicy pages are - maybe it’s those with the most redactions, <code>***</code>?</p>
<p>Let’s count redactions per page:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>redact_n &lt;- str_count(rr_text, pattern = &quot;\\*\\*\\*&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Now add these to a tibble, alongside the (pdf, as opposed to printed) page number and original page text for later analyses.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_tib &lt;- tibble(page = 1:length(rr_text),
                 text = rr_text,
                 redactions = redact_n)</code></pre>
<div id="histogram" class="section level3">
<h3>Histogram</h3>
<p>A histogram of those redactions:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(rr_tib, aes(x=redactions)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, fill = &quot;firebrick&quot;, color = &quot;white&quot;) +
  labs(x = &quot;Number of redactions&quot;,
       y = &quot;Count&quot;,
       title = &quot;Redactions per page in the Russia Report&quot;) +
  theme_classic()</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png" width="576" /></p>
</div>
<div id="which-pages-have-the-most-redactions" class="section level3">
<h3>Which pages have the most redactions?</h3>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_tib %&gt;%
  filter(redactions &gt;= 10) %&gt;%
  select(page, redactions) %&gt;%
  arrange(redactions) %&gt;%
  kable()</code></pre>
<table>

<p>The section on PDF pages 37 and 38 (printed page nums 30 and 31) is the winner: “Rising to the challenge”. Here’s a link to the <a href="https://inductivestep.github.io/Russia-Report/20200721_HC632_CCS001_CCS1019402408-001_ISC_Russia_Report_Web_Accessible.pdf#page=37">pdf pages</a>.</p>

<div id="word-counts" class="section level2">
<h2>Word counts</h2>
<p>For this, I’ll use the <code>tidytext</code> package, which is introduced in a <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">great book</a> by <a href="https://juliasilge.com/">Julia Silge</a> and <a href="http://varianceexplained.org/">David Robinson</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(tidytext)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s a tidy tibble with all the words, using <code>unnest_tokens</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_words &lt;- rr_tib %&gt;%
  select(page,text) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word, # name of the new column
                text) # column with text</code></pre>
<p>The top 20 most common words, excluding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop words</a>, are:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_words %&gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words, by = &quot;word&quot;) %&gt;%
  count(word) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%
  head(20) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(word, n),
             y = n,
             fill = n)) +
    geom_bar(stat = &quot;identity&quot;) + 
    coord_flip() +
    labs(y = &quot;Count&quot;,
         x = &quot;Word&quot;) + 
    theme(legend.position = &quot;none&quot;)</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-8-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>It might also be fun to find initialisms like MI5, etc. - we can do that with a regular expression.</p>
<p>The previous scan of all words reduced them to lower case, so let’s go again using <code>unnest_tokens</code> with <code>to_lower = FALSE</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>initialism_regex &lt;- &quot;([A-Z]{2})|(([A-Z].){2})&quot;

rr_initialisms &lt;- rr_tib %&gt;%
  select(page,text) %&gt;%
  unnest_tokens(word,
                text,
                to_lower = FALSE) %&gt;%
  filter(str_detect(word, initialism_regex))

head(rr_initialisms)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 6 x 2
##    page word         
##   &lt;int&gt; &lt;chr&gt;        
## 1     1 HC           
## 2     2 HC           
## 3     3 ISBN         
## 4     3 CCS1019402408
## 5     3 UK           
## 6     3 APS</code></pre>
<p>It’s apparent that this picks up too many, e.g., there are some upper case words like “INTELLIGENCE”. I’ve selected a few interesting actual initialisms for later.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_initialisms %&gt;%
  group_by(word) %&gt;%
  count() %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%
  kable()</code></pre>

<h2>Sentence-level analysis</h2>
<p>Is there a relationship between which intelligence service (e.g., MI5, MI6, or GCHQ) is mentioned and whether there is a redaction in that sentence?</p>
<p>Again use <code>tidytext</code>, but this time at the sentence level.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_sentences &lt;- rr_tib %&gt;%
  unnest_sentences(sentence, text,
                   to_lower = FALSE) %&gt;%
  select(-redactions) # remove page-level count of redactions

rr_sentences$sentence_i &lt;- 1:nrow(rr_sentences)</code></pre>
<p>That worked reasonably well, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Citations at the end of sentences confused it (possible to fix this by using <code>unnest_regex</code>).</li>
<li>Footnotes need to be addressed separately (they are sentences beginning with numbers, once the aforementioned sentence problem has been fixed).</li>
<li>It doesn’t deal with sentences which cross pages - definitely not when there’s a footnote splitting them too (it may be possible to fix this problem by removing footnotes, gluing all the sentences together, and unnesting again).</li>
</ul>
<p>Next: code redactions and whether sentences mention one of the big three intel agencies (and some other organisations, for comparison).</p>
<p>I’ll use (the fantastic!) <code>fuzzyjoin</code> for this, which joins two tables based on a regular expression.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(fuzzyjoin)</code></pre>
<p>Here’s the mapping:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mapping &lt;- tribble(
  ~regex, ~code,
  &quot;MI5|[s|S]ecurity [s|S]ervice&quot;,        &quot;org_MI5&quot;,
  &quot;MI6|SIS|Secret Intelligence Service&quot;, &quot;org_MI6&quot;,
  &quot;GCHQ&quot;,                                &quot;org_GCHQ&quot;,
  &quot;Defence Intelligence|DI&quot;,             &quot;org_DI&quot;,
  &quot;GRU&quot;,                                 &quot;org_GRU&quot;,
  &quot;NATO&quot;,                                &quot;org_NATO&quot;,
  &quot;RIS&quot;,                                 &quot;org_RIS&quot;,
  &quot;NCSC&quot;,                                &quot;org_NCSC&quot;,
  &quot;NSS&quot;,                                 &quot;org_NSS&quot;,
  &quot;OSCT&quot;,                                &quot;org_OSCT&quot;,
  &quot;ISC&quot;,                                 &quot;org_ISC&quot;,
  &quot;FCO&quot;,                                 &quot;org_FCO&quot;,
  &quot;UN&quot;,                                  &quot;org_UN&quot;,
  &quot;RAF&quot;,                                 &quot;org_RAF&quot;,
  &quot;JIC&quot;,                                 &quot;org_JIC&quot;,
  &quot;DCMS&quot;,                                &quot;org_DCMS&quot;,
  initialism_regex,                      &quot;initialism&quot;,
  &quot;\\*\\*\\*&quot;,                           &quot;redacted&quot;
)</code></pre>
<p>Now, fuzzyjoin and reshape so that there’s a binary variable for each feature:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_mentions &lt;- rr_sentences %&gt;%
  regex_left_join(mapping,
                  by = c(sentence = &quot;regex&quot;)) %&gt;%
  group_by(sentence_i, code) %&gt;%
  count() %&gt;%
  pivot_wider(names_from = code,
              values_from = n,
              values_fill = 0) %&gt;%
  rowwise() %&gt;%
  mutate(any_org = 
           max(c_across(starts_with(&quot;org_&quot;)))) %&gt;%
  select(-&quot;NA&quot;)

rr_sentences &lt;- rr_sentences %&gt;%
  left_join(rr_mentions, by = &quot;sentence_i&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Make a summary variable of the services mentioned.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_sentences$mentioned_services &lt;- rr_sentences %&gt;%
  select(starts_with(&quot;org_&quot;)) %&gt;%
  handbag::binary_patterns_var(strip_prefix = &quot;org_&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s count them:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_sentences %&gt;%
  count(mentioned_services) %&gt;%
  arrange(desc(n)) %&gt;%
  kable(col.names = c(&quot;Service(s) mentioned&quot;, &quot;n&quot;))</code></pre>

<h2>Word cloud of redactions</h2>
<p>Now we have data labelled in various ways, it’s easy to make word clouds comparing words in sentences which have redactions with those which don’t.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s just do this for all sentences:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>rr_sentiment %&gt;%
  anti_join(stop_words) %&gt;%
  mutate(redacted = recode(redacted,
                           `0` = &quot;No redactions&quot;,
                           `1` = &quot;One or more redactions&quot;)) %&gt;%
  group_by(redacted, word) %&gt;%
  summarise(n = n()) %&gt;%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n)) %&gt;%
  filter(prop &gt; .002) %&gt;%
  ggplot(aes(label = word, size = log1p(prop), color = redacted)) +
    scale_size_area(max_size = 11) +
    geom_text_wordcloud() +
    theme_minimal() + 
    facet_grid(cols = vars(redacted))</code></pre>
<p><img src="index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-32-1.png" width="576" /></p>
<p>Some words are irritating in the output - remove these:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>excluded_words &lt;- c(&quot;gchq&quot;,
                    &quot;mi6&quot;,
                    &quot;mi5&quot;,
                    &quot;sis&quot;,
                    &quot;intelligence&quot;,
                    &quot;www.mi5&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>(Note below how stop words have been removed too with <code>anti_join</code>).</p>

  mutate(services_wrapped = stringr::str_wrap(mentioned_services,5)) %&gt;%
