<h2>Finding the juiciest pages</h2>
<p>I’d like to know where the juicy pages are - one way to index them is by number of reduction marks, ***.</p>
<p>First try for one page to get the hang of it. I had a look at page 10 and there was one.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str_count(rr_text[10], pattern = &quot;\\*\\*\\*&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 1</code></pre>
<p>It worked - hurrah. Try for page 8 which has none.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>str_count(rr_text[8], pattern = &quot;\\*\\*\\*&quot;)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>str_count(rr_text[12], pattern = &quot;\\*\\*\\*&quot;)</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>redact_n &lt;- str_count(rr_text, pattern = &quot;\\*\\*\\*&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s stick these in a tibble, alongside the (pdf, as opposed to printed) page number and original page text.</p>

<p>increasing privacy protection – including ubiquitous encryption – presents particular problems for GCHQ, and in the case of Russia it faces a real SIGINT challenge with the use by the Russian government of <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 98. In terms of human intelligence (HUMINT) operations, technological advancements that gather and analyse data on individuals have generally increased the difficulty <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. The expansion of smart city technology (such as CCTV, smart sensors and mobile device tracking), and the capability that this provides, has increased the ability of <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 108 <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. (iii) The risk of escalation 99. Covert activity against any state carries the potential for conflict, and action against a nuclear hostile state even more so given the risk of escalation into diplomatic, economic or even military conflict. The Agencies and Defence Intelligence must therefore be particularly discerning <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 100. In the case of Russia, the potential for escalation is particularly potent: the Russian regime is paranoid about Western intelligence activities and “is not able to treat objectively” international condemnation of its actions. 109 It views any such moves as Western efforts to encourage internal protest and regime change. The risk is compounded by limitations on UK engagement with the Russian government at official and political levels, making deciphering Russian leadership intent even more difficult. Rising to the challenge (i) Focus 101. Due to the difficulty of <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>, the Intelligence Community have focused their effort on <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> main strategic targets, which they assess will provide insight on the most important strategic topics, with intelligence on the lowest priorities collected on an ‘opportunity-only’ basis. These key targets are <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 102. <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 110 103. SIS told us that this means operating with “strategic patience” in terms of both recruiting agents and increasing staff. 111 Whilst there are a <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> group of staff working on this issue, SIS was clear that a sudden surge in numbers would not yield results more quickly. 112 It is the difficulty of recruiting Russian agents with the right accesses, and the careful planning, tradecraft and operational security around any prospective agents – so as to ensure their safety and minimise any political risk to HMG – which means that it takes a relatively long time for intelligence efforts to produce results. 108 Oral evidence – GCHQ, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> December 2018. 109 Oral evidence – MI5, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> November 2018. 110 Written evidence – 2018 ICE Plan requirements for Russia. 111 Oral evidence – SIS, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> December 2018. 112 Oral evidence – SIS, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> December 2018; we note that SIS <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> and has a “series of protections” around the people who do go into the team. 30</p>

<li>Using a range of capabilities</li>
</ol>
<ol start="104" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Russia is a particularly hard operating environment for other countries’ intelligence officers, so <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 113 <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 114 As a result, HUMINT opportunities need to be sought elsewhere. This may be <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 115</li>
<li>Due to the difficulties in finding and operating HUMINT sources on Russia, the Intelligence Community rely on the “bringing together of a range of intelligence disciplines” in order to get the best possible picture of the Russian threat. 116 In relation to SIGINT, GCHQ has focused on not only deploying a broad range of capabilities against Russia, but in joining up with others to use their capabilities in tandem, allowing them to <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>.</li>
<li>Defence Intelligence brings to the table a range of specialised geospatial intelligence (GEOINT) and measurement and signature intelligence (MASINT) capabilities, which can be used to observe Russian targets at a distance, with a focus on military capabilities and organisations. Defence Intelligence has sought to <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> “try to understand how they think and why they think”. 117 Defence Intelligence is also involved in the expansion of HMG’s open source intelligence capabilities (i.e. the analysis of information that can be accessed freely on the internet, or bought through commercial providers) through the Defence Intelligence Open Source Hub. Analysis of open source information is being increasingly used by the Agencies and Defence Intelligence to enhance their overall situational awareness, and can be fused with a smaller proportion of secret intelligence to provide a richer picture.</li>

<ol start="3" style="list-style-type: lower-roman">
<li>Real-world threat, real-world outcomes</li>
</ol>
<ol start="107" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The Committee was struck by the relatively small proportion of <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> work that is carried out by the Agencies in relation to Russia, compared with the intelligence coverage of Russia that is undertaken. For example, SIS usually deploys only <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> of its overall operational Russia effort in support of <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>, whilst GCHQ uses approximately <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>. 118</li>
<li>We were told that, since the overall cross-Whitehall Russia Strategy aim, in relation to Russia, is to develop “a Russia that chooses to co-operate, rather than challenge or confront”, any work must be proportionate to this outcome – notably HMG does not deploy effects with the goal of effecting organisational collapse, in the way that they might be deployed against international terrorist groups, for example. 119 However, of equal concern, it appears, is the need to tread carefully so as not to provoke unexpected escalation. As a result, the Agencies’ effects work primarily concentrates on <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong>; capability-building (the sharing of knowledge and capabilities with partners); and counter-intelligence work to disrupt <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> operations.</li>
<li>We note that the focus on <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> work increased significantly following the events in Salisbury as HMG <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> engaged in a substantive and concerted diplomacy effort to co- ordinate a strong international response to the use of chemical weapons against civilians on UK soil. 120 This raises the question of whether return now to a ‘normal’, relatively low, level of <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> effort against Russia would undermine this, or whether it would now be more 113 GCHQ and Defence Intelligence staff working on Russia are UK based. 114 Oral evidence – SIS, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> December 2018. 115 <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> 116 Oral evidence – Defence Intelligence, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> December 2018. 117 Oral evidence – Defence Intelligence, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> December 2018. 118 Oral evidence – SIS and GCHQ, <strong><em>[redacted]</em></strong> January 2019. 119 More information on this is included in the Strategy, Co-ordination and Tasking section of this Report. 120 The international response to Salisbury is discussed in more detail in the International Partnerships section of this Report. 31</li>
</ol>
<p>appropriate for HMG to capitalise on its strengthened international relationships and push forward with greater emphasis on exposing Russian Hostile State Activity multilaterally; in our view it must be the latter. 32</p>

<p>That worked reasonably well, though citations at the end of sentences confused it (possible to fix with a regex), footnotes need to be addressed separately (they are sentences beginning with numbers, once the aforementioned sentence problem has been fixed), and it probably doesn’t deal with sentences which cross pages - definitely not when there’s a footnote on the first page (possible to fix by removing footnotes then gluing all the sentences together and unnesting again).</p>
